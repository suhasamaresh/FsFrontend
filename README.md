# FlashSuite üåê

**FlashSuite** is the next-generation social+finance platform for groups‚Äîfriends, DAOs, teams, or classrooms‚Äîbuilt from the ground up on Etherlink. Our vision is simple: let groups coordinate, create, reward, and preserve memories in powerful new ways, all on-chain, all under one unified user experience.

## What Is FlashSuite?

FlashSuite is an all-in-one Web3 "operating system" for group life. It enables communities to:

- **Split costs & pool funds (FlashSplit)**
- **Assign, claim, and reward microtasks (FlashBounty, FlashTasks)**
- **Run collaborative study funds (FlashStudy)**
- **Organize Pomodoro sprints (FlashSprint)**
- **Preserve group memories with time-locked capsules (FlashTimeCapsule)**
- ...and more!

Each service is standalone and composable, deployed as a modular smart contract on Etherlink, making FlashSuite both highly flexible and future-proof.

## Smart Contracts

- **FlashSplit:**  
        Group bill splitting and shared vaults‚Äîa true Web3 version of Splitwise, letting groups keep all IOUs on-chain.  
        **Currently, FlashSplit only works with XTZ (Tezos), and support for more currencies will be added soon.**
